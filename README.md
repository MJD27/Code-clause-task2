# Basic Text Editor - Code Clause Internship Project

Welcome to the Basic Text Editor project, developed as part of Task 2 during the Code Clause internship program. This simple yet functional text editor serves as a foundational project to enhance your understanding of programming concepts and user interface development. 

## Project Overview

The Basic Text Editor is a desktop application that enables users to create, edit, and save plain text documents. It provides a user-friendly interface with essential text editing features, making it a great starting point for anyone learning about software development. The project covers fundamental programming principles and GUI (Graphical User Interface) design using a language and framework of your choice.

## Features

- **Text Editing**: Users can input and manipulate text using common operations such as typing, deleting, and copying.

- **File Operations**: The editor allows users to create new documents, open existing ones, and save their work to a file.

- **Basic Formatting**: While this editor focuses on simplicity, you might choose to include basic formatting features like font style, size, and color.

- **Undo/Redo**: Implementing undo and redo functionality can provide a deeper understanding of managing user actions.

## Getting Started

To run the Basic Text Editor on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) (or another programming language of choice) and any necessary libraries or frameworks installed.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MJD27/Code-clause-task2.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Use the terminal or command prompt to move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Code-clause-task2
   ```

4. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file (e.g., `main.py`):

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
